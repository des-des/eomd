## Modes
**EOMD** is a *modal* editor. This means that the effects of any action the user makes depends on what mode the editor is in.

To swap between modes press the \`ESC\` key.

### Edit mode
This is where you will spend most of your time. While in edit mode you will write **markdown** into the currently selected note. (I need to make links work)[www.github.com]
